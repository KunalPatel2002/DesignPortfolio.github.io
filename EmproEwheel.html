    <h3>The Empro E-wheel is a front wheel for any traditional mechanical bike, which would convert it into an e-bike in less than 30 seconds. Conversion kits for mechanical bikes exist, however they all have externally mounted batteries, which greatly increases installation time, leads to messy wiring, and provides a barrier to potential customers who would not be comfortable with this increased installation process. The Empro E-wheel features everything inside the wheel, including the battery, motor, and electronics, to ensure that installation time is under 30 seconds, and requires no tools or previous mechanical experience. It would come in at a much cheaper price point than existing e-bikes, meaning customers could get the experience and convenience of an e-bike at the fraction of the price. </h3>

<h1>PROTOTYPE DESIGN:</h1>
<h3>The ideal design for the final product involves having a custom motor built. While this is feasible for mass production, this is not feasible for us to have done in the limited timespan for the competition, in addition to the budget given. As a result, the prototype version we are currently making, to show the judges as well as for ourselves to learn from, is fairly different from the final design. Rather than using a custom motor, it uses an electric skateboard motor.</h3>
