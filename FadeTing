    <h3>Our climber lifts our robot on all positions of the bar. We use a pneumatic cylinder, a set of belts and pulleys, and three rotating arms to lift our hook to the height of the bar. We use a gearbox and winch to bring the hook down and cause the robot to climb.</h3>

As a result, we were able to make the arms out of .5″ by .5″ rectangular tube with 1/1 6″ thickness, allowing for our assembly to be relatively light. Our first arm is deployed with the use of a pneumatic cylinder. The second and third arms get deployed with the use of a passive belt and pulley system. By rotating the first arm upwards, and keeping the first pulley grounded to the chassis, the first pulley rotates relative to the first bar. This pulley then drives the second pulley, which is used to rotate the second bar. The same system is used to deploy the third bar<br></h3></center></p>

<h3>The winch uses two NEO motors and planetary gearboxs to wind up a drum that brings the hook down, allowing the robot to climb. The two planetary gearboxes are connected with a set of gears. This allows for an additional reduction, while also reducing the load on the planetary gearbox.
At the end of the match, we cannot rely on motor power to keep the winch from unwinding, as the power to these motors gets cut off. Additionally, because we unwind the winch to control the height of the hook, we need the winch to be able to spin in both directions, eliminating using a simple ratchet as a possibility. As a result, we decided to use a friction brake that keeps the winch in place at the end of the match. A 2" bore pneumatic pushes a hub that rotates with the winch drum against a grounded wall on the winch. This prevents the winch from unwinding, allowing the robot to stay up after the match ends.</h3>
